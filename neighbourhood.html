                <h3>Neighbourhood highlights</h3>

                    Quiet, friendly coastal neighbourhood in a quiet street. This is amazing seeing as we are so close
                    to everything. It's a great spot to call a base whilst you explore all the beautiful things to see
                    and do on the Sunshine Coast. You will love walking on the beach daily and the beautiful sunsets.
                    The walk south out to the river entrance break water via Mooloolaba is a must if you love your
                    walking or running or alternately the walk along the beach going in the other direction (north) to
                    the Maroochy Surf Club and the Maroochy River entrance is just as good. Both are regular walks done
                    by the locals. There are lots of cafes along either way to pick up a coffee or have breakfast or
                    just browse the many shops in Mooloolaba or Cotton Tree. It is such a great spot! Everyone loves it!

                    E-Scooters are available just minutes away next to the beach. We are about 3mins from the Motorway
                    by car which takes you north to Noosa or south to Brisbane. The bus stops is only 200 metres away,
                    across the road from the beach. There are 6 buses an hour going to The Sunshine Plaza (our major
                    shopping centre) which is only 5-7 mins bus ride. If you fly into Brisbane and there is a airport
                    shuttle buses CON-X-ION that will drop you at the door. The cost is from $55 per person. Or hire a
                    car and do the drive up yourself. It takes an hour and 15 mins to Alex from Brisbane airport . It is
                    handy to have a car on the Sunshine Coast to be able to have a good look around at all the different
                    places like Noosa, Montville, Eumundi Markets, Australia Zoo and the many other attractions we have
                    to offer. If you fly into the Sunshine Coast you could take a bus or taxi from there. We are only 15
                    mins from the Sunshine Coast Airport airport.
